# Instructions
Assessment of preprocessing techniques on performance of medical image segmentation

Each individual should write a program with Graphic User Interface that perform following step
Select/Choose image
Save the preprocessed and segmented images
Display the chosen image's histogram
Preprocessing: average and median filtering; histogram equalization with size and shape of the mask should be selected.
      Calculate and display corresponding PSNR values
 Segmentation: minimize probability of error (Kapur method) and maximize variance between class (Otsu method)
      Evaluate and display segmentation performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, FPpI (False Positives per Image) with different preprocessing methods


# Note
Data for evaluation:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/cbis-ddsm-breast-cancer-image-dataset
      
Programming language is on your selection. Matlab, C#/C++ or Python are all excepted.
Try to code yourself. Do not use available functions for at least for segmentation tasks.
Self report should include: captures of results for several images; final assessment on whole dataset; discussions on effectiveness on different type of images (high, medium, small density)

"been a while since last use GitHub"

# Directions
Gradio: https://www.gradio.app
PyQt5: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
Gonna try Gradio first due to its learning curve
